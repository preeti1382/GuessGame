# GuessGame
Problem Statement:- Generate a random integer from a to b. You and your friend have to guess a number between  two numbers a and b. a and b are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and  plays first. He will have to keep choosing the number and your program must tell whether  the number is greater than the actual number or less than the actual number. Log the  number of trials it took your friend to arrive at the number. You play the same game and  then the person with minimum number of trials wins! Randomly generate a number after taking  a and b as input and donâ€™t show that to the user.
